### Cronjobs

It is possible to adapt the `pretixuser` crontab entries by modifying the [crontab](docker/pretix/crontab) file.

## TLS setup

You can specify the used TLS certificates by adapting the mounted [certificate](docker/pretix/files/config/ssl/domain.crt) and [key](docker/pretix/files/config/ssl/domain.key) e.g. from Let's Encrypt or generating new self-signed certificates by following the [manual](scripts/EXAMPLE-CERT-CREATION.md) and moving the generated files. It is also possible to adapt the [used](docker/pretix/nginx/nginx.conf) Nginx configuration.
